# Project-WoHuCangLong(Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon)

Personal Project, uses Scriptable Objects to modify the rigidbody2D force in play mode(super convenient).

All the codes in Scripts/Scriptable Obejects folder are written by Blaer.

The only C# Script concerning the homework is ActionForceScriptableObject.cs, and all the comments are in that file(actually not that much comments).

Use 1 Keyboard+1 Gamepad/ 2 Gamepads to play:

For Keyboard, WASD to bend the bamboo, Arrow Keys to wave the sword

For Gamepad, Left Joystick to bend the bamboo, Right Joystick to wave the sword
